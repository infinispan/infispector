Referral program notes:

* More personalized: http://i.imgur.com/ommVrvg.png doesn't mention who
referred, doesn't have a "link below", and doesn't really convey the value prop
too well.
* Take advantage of celebrities - maybe find users on twitter with lots of
followers and encourage them to tweet?
